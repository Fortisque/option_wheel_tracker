<h2>Option Selling Call Choices</h2>
<p>When selling a call, hopefully you've picked a good stock, so you don't mind
holding onto the stock for awhile and continuing to reap premiums. Ideally the call lands
in the money, thus selling our stock, and we repeat the wheel from scratch. Therefore, the
only thing to maximize is annualized rate of return. By default we assume we need at least
a 30% chance of selling the stock successfully, since we might not want to be holding this stock
for too long</p>
<p>Annualized rate of return is computed fairly bullish as (max_return * odds_otm) ^ (252 / calendar_days_total_for_wheel) + (1 - odds_otm) * (current_price - cost_basis). This assumes that if you keep the stock you'd be able to sell it on the open market for roughly the same amount
as the current price.</p>
<p>If you want to be more bearish on the stock, then you'll want to maximum the odds you can get rid of the stock. This will cut into your gains, but will make sure you can repeat the
wheel process on a new stock quickly. In this strategy you would ignore annualized rate of return,
set the minimum odds to a fairly high number such as 70, then sort by calendar days to minimize
the days to expiry</p>
